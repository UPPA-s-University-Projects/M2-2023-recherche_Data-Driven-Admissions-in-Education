	shorttitle = {Graduation Rates},
	abstract = {This study looked at the relationship between the programs students chose upon college entry, the programs from which they graduated, and the time taken to graduate. Individual student data on more than 204,000 freshmen entering 38 public, land grant, and Research I universities in 1988 and 1990 were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize student entry characteristics such as college admission test scores and high school grade point averages. Logistic analysis was used to calculate and compare predicted and actual graduation rates based on student entry characteristics. Among findings were: graduation rates varied more by university than by program; time to completion varied by academic program; business and social sciences were the program areas which  experienced the largest in-migration from other areas; students entering education programs had the lowest average Scholastic Assessment Test scores whereas engineering students had the highest; students initially undecided about their major were no less likely to graduate than other students and their graduation was not delayed; there was a correlation of about .28 between actual and predicted graduation rates; and there were significant differences among institutions between actual graduation rates and predicted graduation rates. Tables provide detailed findings for each institutions. ({DB})},
