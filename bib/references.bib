	abstract = {There would be no need for sociology if everyone understood the social frameworks within which we operate. That we do have a connection to the larger picture is largely thanks to the pioneering thinker Émile Durkheim. He recognized that, if anything can explain how we as individuals relate to society, then it is suicide: Why does it happen? What goes wrong? Why is it more common in some places than others? In seeking answers to these questions, Durkheim wrote a work that has fascinated, challenged and informed its readers for over a hundred years. Far-sighted and trail-blazing in its conclusions, Suicide makes an immense contribution to our understanding to what must surely be one of the least understandable of acts. A brilliant study, it is regarded as one of the most important books Durkheim ever wrote.},

	abstract = {Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.: 587–588 The first algorithm for random decision forests was created in 1995 by Tin Kam Ho using the random subspace method, which, in Ho's formulation, is a way to implement the "stochastic discrimination" approach to classification proposed by Eugene Kleinberg.An extension of the algorithm was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, who registered "Random Forests" as a trademark in 2006 (as of 2019, owned by Minitab, Inc.). The extension combines Breiman's "bagging" idea and random selection of features, introduced first by Ho and later independently by Amit and Geman in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variance.},

The concept calls for new forms of theorizing of global collective action. The diversity and heterogeneity of meta-organizations raise methodological issues that require original approaches. In this paper, we show the novelty of the concept of meta-organization; we then address the methodological difficulties and propose a research agenda on meta-organizations for management studies.},

We suggest that majority groups defining the definitions and measures of success may exert “soft power” over minoritized student success. Using a hegemonic and critical race theory lens, we examined five years of research articles in {CBE}—Life Sciences Education to explore how success was defined and measured and what frameworks guided the definitions of student success. The majority of articles did not explicitly define success, inherently suggesting “everyone knows” its definition. The articles that did define success often used quantitative, academic outcomes like grade point average and exam scores, despite commonly cited frameworks with other metrics. When students defined success, they focused on different aspects, such as gaining leadership skills and building career networks, suggesting a need to integrate student voice into current success definitions. Using these results, we provide suggestions for research, policy, and practice regarding student success. We urge self-reflection and institutional change in our definitions of success, via consideration of a diversity of student voices.},

Following a ‘combined model’ of student choice, which emphasises economic and social factors, this paper aims to answer two main related questions: (i) what are the determinants of student choice consistency? (ii) Does choice consistency affect the admission of students to their top preference? Both are analysed within a multinomial logit framework. The results indicate that males, older students and better performing students are more likely to be consistent in their choices in the various forms it may assume. Students with inconsistent choice sets are more likely to be accepted; nevertheless, they are more likely to get a place in a second-best alternative.},

	abstract = {In universities, student dropout is a major concern that reflects the university's quality. Some characteristics cause students to drop out of university. A high dropout rate of students affects the university's reputation and the student's careers in the future. Therefore, there's a requirement for student dropout analysis to enhance academic plan and management to scale back student's drop out from the university also on enhancing the standard of the upper education system. The machine learning technique provides powerful methods for the analysis and therefore the prediction of the dropout. This study uses a dataset from a university representative to develop a model for predicting student dropout. In this work, machinelearning models were used to detect dropout rates. Machine learning is being more widely used in the field of knowledge mining diagnostics. Following an examination of certain studies, we observed that dropout detection may be done using several methods. We've even used five dropout detection models. These models are Decision tree, Naïve bayes, Random Forest Classifier, {SVM} and {KNN}. We used machine-learning technology to analyze the data, and we discovered that the Random Forest classifier is highly promising for predicting dropout rates, with a training accuracy of 94\% and a testing accuracy of 86\%.},

Without further assumption the reliability of a test is defined. Parallel measurements are then independently defined, and the concept of replication is explicated. The derived axioms of the classical test theory model are then stated in a refined form of Woodbury's stochastic process notation, and the basic results of this model are derived. The assumptions of experimental independence, homogeneity of error distribution, and conditional independence are related to the classical model and to each other.

	abstract = {Higher education is a key factor in Thai national development. Promoting educational quality and improving the quality of learners are challenging for our government. One of the most common educational problems is a university dropout problem which has a negative impact not only on the economic level but also on the personal level of students. Then, in this study, we focus on the study of factors affecting undergraduates' educational status and to create binary classification models for predicting their educational status whether will be Dropout or Other (i.e., other statuses which are not dropout) when they were studying at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi ({KMUTT}), Bangkok, Thailand. By applying the principles of data mining and machine learning techniques, we first collect data from the {KMUTT} internal data sources, i.e., Registrar's Office and {KMUTT} Library After that we investigate the completeness and the quality of the data, as well as we, investigate which features are meant to improve the accuracy and applicability of our models. Particularly, the data used in our analysis are from 13,714 undergraduate students in 7 academic years which are from the academic year 2012-2013 to 2019-2020. We develop 3 classifiers based on a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting classification. The results show that the prediction accuracy of gradient boosting, decision tree and random forest models are 93\%, 92\%, and 92\% respectively. Moreover, we found that the top 5 important features are student's academic year, high-school {GPA}, channels of university admission, student's faculty, and gender. In summary, the model constructed using gradient boosting outperforms the others with the most accuracy and recall but the random forest model can outperform the others with the most dropout status precision.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner.},

We evaluate how predictive performance changes over the three models, and observe a substantially increased performance when including variables from the first study experiences, resulting in an {AUC} (area under the curve) of 0.86. Important predictors are the final grade at secondary school, and also determinants associated with student satisfaction and their subjective academic self-concept and self-assessment.

However, the inherent class imbalance between dropout and non-dropout students could pose difficulty in building accurate predictive modeling for a dropout early warning system. The present study aimed to improve the performance of a dropout early warning system: (a) by addressing the class imbalance issue using the synthetic minority oversampling techniques ({SMOTE}) and the ensemble methods in machine learning; and (b) by evaluating the trained classifiers with both receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) and precision–recall ({PR}) curves. To that end, we trained random forest, boosted decision tree, random forest with {SMOTE}, and boosted decision tree with {SMOTE} using the big data samples of the 165,715 high school students from the National Education Information System ({NEIS}) in South Korea. According to our {ROC} and {PR} curve analysis, boosted decision tree showed the optimal performance.},

But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

This research presents a neural network approach through the application of multilayer perceptrom algorithms and radial basis function. As input variables to the models, 11 factors were considered, which produce a negative influence in the desertion at the universities; the data was obtained from a survey of 2670 students of a Public University in Ecuador. The results showed that there is no significant difference in the accuracy rates of the proposed models which correspond to 96.3\% for multilayer perceptrom and 96.8\% for radial basis function.

The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

La construcción del modelo de investigación se sustentó en una exhaustiva revisión bibliográfica que permitió identificar variables explicativas de la deserción universitaria en el contexto nacional. Luego, a partir de la sistematización de antecedentes socioeducativos de los estudiantes de las cohortes 2014 y 2015 disponibles en los sistemas informáticos de la universidad, se consolidó una matriz tripartita con los datos asociados a las variables que emergieron del análisis de los referentes consultados. Consecuentemente, se analizó la relación de cada una de las variables explicativas del estudio con la variable control deserción estudiantil. El análisis bivariado permitió identificar diecisiete variables, significativamente asociadas con la deserción estudiantil y precisar las relaciones de dependencia con el abandono de estudios. El modelo multivariado predijo en un 86,4 \% la conducta de abandono señalando siete variables categóricas independientes que, finalmente, se develan como factores relevantes del modelo predicción. Las variadas y sustentadas interpretaciones entregadas en los resultados del modelo, así como las sugerencias propuestas para mejorar el índice de retención universitaria, entregan un valor directo al estudio dirigido a optimizar uno de los indicadores más importantes vinculados a una gestión de calidad en las universidades, como es, la retención estudiantil.},

	abstract = {We develop a new model and algorithms for machine learning-based learning analytics, which estimate a learner's knowledge of the concepts underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimate the relationships among a collection of questions and those concepts. Our model represents the probability that a learner provides the correct response to a question in terms of three factors: their understanding of a set of underlying concepts, the concepts involved in each question, and each question's intrinsic difficulty. We estimate these factors given the graded responses to a collection of questions. The underlying estimation problem is ill-posed in general, especially when only a subset of the questions are answered. The key observation that enables a well-posed solution is the fact that typical educational domains of interest involve only a small number of key concepts. Leveraging this observation, we develop both a bi-convex maximum-likelihood-based solution and a Bayesian solution to the resulting {SPARse} Factor Analysis ({SPARFA}) problem. We also incorporate user-defined tags on questions to facilitate the interpretability of the estimated factors. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Finally, we make a connection between {SPARFA} and noisy, binary-valued (1-bit) dictionary learning that is of independent interest.},

The variables of previous performance (grades) are the best predictors of final achievement, but if removed, metacognitive variables (Time Management and the Effort Management) and volitional strategies (Negative-Based Incentives) come into play in predicting performance. Volitional variables may be considered as latent variables with an indirect influence over the final grades, but with a direct influence over the learning strategies. Such complex relationships ({LISREL}) should be more thoroughly researched in the future. No statistical differences between men and women were found in any of the variables.

The size was 364 and the technical questionnaire was applied to 383 students. Information was complemented with interviews and documentary reviews. As main results the causes that originate the problem are validated, these are the high costs of tuition and the loss of materials, which are identified ways to decrease the dropout. It is evident that these are few and a little diverse, which is aggravated by the ignorance of the students about the benefits offered by these institutions; in response to this, a proposal to establish policies linked to the increase of these alternatives and improve the communication process between the various institutions that offer financial services and/or scholarships to students is given.},

However, research has been ambiguous about what factors can improve it. Two reasons for this ambiguity are discussed in this paper: The links between workplace learning and professional education have often not been included in research studies, and teaching may have special characteristics that make workplace learning difficult. The paper examines new empirical connections between teachers’ learning activities at work and the outcome of teacher education, using longitudinal Norwegian survey data. The results show that an active and independent study strategy increases the likelihood of consulting professionals outside work and finding information in books and journals. Furthermore, the introduction of individual characterristics substantially improves the work place impact models, and should be adopted in future research. Finally, it is discussed whether the methodological framework in existing research on teachers’ work place learning is consistent with the theoretical point of departure, or whether greater consistency should be sought.},

Most universities would benefit from an early warning system that detects at-risk students before performance or social problems jeopardize their college careers. This investigation demonstrated that scores from the Survey of Academic Orientations ({SAO}) were predictive of first-semester freshmen grades. Subsequent analysis showed that the {SAO} significantly improved the prediction of grade point averages, after taking the effects of Scholastic Assessment Test scores and high school percentage rank into consideration. The {SAO} gives educators a new early warning device, a way to identify those undergraduates most at risk of receiving poor grades. The next steps in the research process are to: (1) assess the relationship of {SAO} scores to other important academic indexes, such as retention and student stress, and (2) determine if furnishing counselors and other college personnel with {SAO} scores is of therapeutic value.},

	shorttitle = {Graduation Rates},
	abstract = {This study looked at the relationship between the programs students chose upon college entry, the programs from which they graduated, and the time taken to graduate. Individual student data on more than 204,000 freshmen entering 38 public, land grant, and Research I universities in 1988 and 1990 were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize student entry characteristics such as college admission test scores and high school grade point averages. Logistic analysis was used to calculate and compare predicted and actual graduation rates based on student entry characteristics. Among findings were: graduation rates varied more by university than by program; time to completion varied by academic program; business and social sciences were the program areas which  experienced the largest in-migration from other areas; students entering education programs had the lowest average Scholastic Assessment Test scores whereas engineering students had the highest; students initially undecided about their major were no less likely to graduate than other students and their graduation was not delayed; there was a correlation of about .28 between actual and predicted graduation rates; and there were significant differences among institutions between actual graduation rates and predicted graduation rates. Tables provide detailed findings for each institutions. ({DB})},
