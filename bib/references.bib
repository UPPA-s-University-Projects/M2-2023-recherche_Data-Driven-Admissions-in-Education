	abstract = {La première année à l’université est marquée par un taux de réussite et de persévérance assez faible. Pour expliquer ce phénomène, on a d’abord pris en compte les caractéristiques sociodémographiques et le passé scolaire des étudiants. Mais, depuis une trentaine d’années, d’autres dimensions ont été étudiées en se basant sur des courants théoriques distincts. D’une part, les modèles éducationnels (Tinto, 1975, 1997 ; Bean, 1980) soulignent à la fois l’importance des expériences sociales et académiques vécues lors de la transition à l’université et l’importance de l’ajustement entre les caractéristiques individuelles et institutionnelles ; d’autre part, les modèles motivationnels (Wigfield \& Eccles, 2000 ; Eccles \& Wigfield, 2002 ; Kahn \& Nauta, 2001) se focalisent sur les attributs personnels des étudiants (par exemple le sentiment de compétence, les représentations des buts, etc.). En validant le modèle de Tinto dans le contexte éducationnel belge et en analysant le rôle complémentaire du sentiment d’efficacité personnelle, nous tentons ici de mettre en évidence l’apport de ces différents courants théoriques dans la compréhension des facteurs de persévérance. Cette contribution s’intéresse particulièrement à l’intention de persévérance, mesurée dès les premières semaines passées à l’université, car elle constitue l’un des facteurs majeurs dans la persévérance effective et est positivement associée à la réussite finale. Nos résultats démontrent que la persévérance et la réussite, loin d’être déterminées exclusivement par le bagage d’entrée de l’étudiant, sont significativement influencées par des variables individuelles et des variables contextuelles, ainsi que par l’interaction entre les deux. Cet article met ainsi en lumière l’importance du contexte éducatif et le rôle que peuvent jouer les acteurs du terrain. Ces derniers peuvent soutenir la persévérance et la réussite des étudiants, non seulement par la mise en œuvre de dispositifs pédagogiques adaptés (misant sur les relations entre pairs, l’apprentissage coopératif, l’utilité et l’intérêt des activités), mais aussi par leurs interventions auprès des étudiants pour soutenir leur sentiment d’efficacité personnelle et la construction de leur projet de formation.},

However, these models were developed with on-campus programs in mind and, although they are broadly relevant to distance education programs, their ability to explain the persistence of online students is limited. Distance education students have characteristics and needs that differ from traditional learners and the virtual learning environment differs in important ways from an on-campus environment. This article draws chiefly from Tinto’s and Bean and Metzner’s models and the results of research into the needs of online distance education students in order to synthesize a composite model to better explain persistence and attrition among the largely nontraditional students that enroll in online courses.},

The algorithm is non-parametric and can efficiently deal with large, complicated datasets without imposing a complicated parametric structure. When the sample size is large enough, study data can be divided into training and validation datasets. Using the training dataset to build a decision tree model and a validation dataset to decide on the appropriate tree size needed to achieve the optimal final model.

Detecting rare events can be viewed as a prediction task in data mining and machine learning communities. As these events are rarely observed in daily life, the prediction task suffers from a lack of balanced data. In this paper, we provide an in depth review of rare event detection from an imbalanced learning perspective. Five hundred and seventeen related papers that have been published in the past decade were collected for the study. The initial statistics suggested that rare events detection and imbalanced learning are concerned across a wide range of research areas from management science to engineering. We reviewed all collected papers from both a technical and a practical point of view. Modeling methods discussed include techniques such as data preprocessing, classification algorithms and model evaluation. For applications, we first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the existing application domains of imbalanced learning, and then we detail the applications for each category. Finally, some suggestions from the reviewed papers are incorporated with our experiences and judgments to offer further research directions for the imbalanced learning and rare event detection fields.},

This issue occurs when the number of examples that represent one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. In machine learning, the ensemble of classifiers are known to increase the accuracy of single classifiers by combining several of them, but neither of these learning techniques alone solve the class imbalance problem, to deal with this issue the ensemble learning algorithms have to be designed specifically. In this paper, our aim is to review the state of the art on ensemble techniques in the framework of imbalanced data-sets, with focus on two-class problems. We propose a taxonomy for ensemble-based methods to address the class imbalance where each proposal can be categorized depending on the inner ensemble methodology in which it is based. In addition, we develop a thorough empirical comparison by the consideration of the most significant published approaches, within the families of the taxonomy proposed, to show whether any of them makes a difference. This comparison has shown the good behavior of the simplest approaches which combine random undersampling techniques with bagging or boosting ensembles. In addition, the positive synergy between sampling techniques and bagging has stood out. Furthermore, our results show empirically that ensemble-based algorithms are worthwhile since they outperform the mere use of preprocessing techniques before learning the classifier, therefore justifying the increase of complexity by means of a significant enhancement of the results.},

In seeking answers to these questions, Durkheim wrote a work that has fascinated, challenged and informed its readers for over a hundred years. Far-sighted and trail-blazing in its conclusions, Suicide makes an immense contribution to our understanding to what must surely be one of the least understandable of acts.

The concept calls for new forms of theorizing of global collective action. The diversity and heterogeneity of meta-organizations raise methodological issues that require original approaches.

However, representation and achievement gaps relative to the majority still exist for minoritized students at all levels of science education and beyond. We suggest that majority groups defining the definitions and measures of success may exert “soft power” over minoritized student success. Using a hegemonic and critical race theory lens, we examined five years of research articles in {CBE}—Life Sciences Education to explore how success was defined and measured and what frameworks guided the definitions of student success. The majority of articles did not explicitly define success, inherently suggesting “everyone knows” its definition. The articles that did define success often used quantitative, academic outcomes like grade point average and exam scores, despite commonly cited frameworks with other metrics. When students defined success, they focused on different aspects, such as gaining leadership skills and building career networks, suggesting a need to integrate student voice into current success definitions. Using these results, we provide suggestions for research, policy, and practice regarding student success. We urge self-reflection and institutional change in our definitions of success, via consideration of a diversity of student voices.},

Following a ‘combined model’ of student choice, which emphasises economic and social factors, this paper aims to answer two main related questions: (i) what are the determinants of student choice consistency? (ii) Does choice consistency affect the admission of students to their top preference? Both are analysed within a multinomial logit framework. The results indicate that males, older students and better performing students are more likely to be consistent in their choices in the various forms it may assume. Students with inconsistent choice sets are more likely to be accepted; nevertheless, they are more likely to get a place in a second-best alternative.},

	abstract = {In universities, student dropout is a major concern that reflects the university's quality. Some characteristics cause students to drop out of university. A high dropout rate of students affects the university's reputation and the student's careers in the future. Therefore, there's a requirement for student dropout analysis to enhance academic plan and management to scale back student's drop out from the university also on enhancing the standard of the upper education system. The machine learning technique provides powerful methods for the analysis and therefore the prediction of the dropout. This study uses a dataset from a university representative to develop a model for predicting student dropout. In this work, machinelearning models were used to detect dropout rates. Machine learning is being more widely used in the field of knowledge mining diagnostics. Following an examination of certain studies, we observed that dropout detection may be done using several methods. We've even used five dropout detection models. These models are Decision tree, Naïve bayes, Random Forest Classifier, {SVM} and {KNN}. We used machine-learning technology to analyze the data, and we discovered that the Random Forest classifier is highly promising for predicting dropout rates, with a training accuracy of 94\% and a testing accuracy of 86\%.},

Without further assumption the reliability of a test is defined. Parallel measurements are then independently defined, and the concept of replication is explicated. The derived axioms of the classical test theory model are then stated in a refined form of Woodbury's stochastic process notation, and the basic results of this model are derived. The assumptions of experimental independence, homogeneity of error distribution, and conditional independence are related to the classical model and to each other. Finally, a brief sketch of some stronger models assuming the independence of error and true scores or the existence of higher-order moments of error distributions or those making specific distributional assumptions is given.},

One of the most common educational problems is a university dropout problem which has a negative impact not only on the economic level but also on the personal level of students. Then, in this study, we focus on the study of factors affecting undergraduates' educational status and to create binary classification models for predicting their educational status whether will be Dropout or Other (i.e., other statuses which are not dropout) when they were studying at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi ({KMUTT}), Bangkok, Thailand. By applying the principles of data mining and machine learning techniques, we first collect data from the {KMUTT} internal data sources, i.e., Registrar's Office and {KMUTT} Library After that we investigate the completeness and the quality of the data, as well as we, investigate which features are meant to improve the accuracy and applicability of our models. Particularly, the data used in our analysis are from 13,714 undergraduate students in 7 academic years which are from the academic year 2012-2013 to 2019-2020. We develop 3 classifiers based on a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting classification. The results show that the prediction accuracy of gradient boosting, decision tree and random forest models are 93\%, 92\%, and 92\% respectively. Moreover, we found that the top 5 important features are student's academic year, high-school {GPA}, channels of university admission, student's faculty, and gender. In summary, the model constructed using gradient boosting outperforms the others with the most accuracy and recall but the random forest model can outperform the others with the most dropout status precision.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner.},

We evaluate how predictive performance changes over the three models, and observe a substantially increased performance when including variables from the first study experiences, resulting in an {AUC} (area under the curve) of 0.86. Important predictors are the final grade at secondary school, and also determinants associated with student satisfaction and their subjective academic self-concept and self-assessment.

	abstract = {A dropout early warning system enables schools to preemptively identify students who are at risk of dropping out of school, to promptly react to them, and eventually to help potential dropout students to continue their learning for a better future. However, the inherent class imbalance between dropout and non-dropout students could pose difficulty in building accurate predictive modeling for a dropout early warning system. The present study aimed to improve the performance of a dropout early warning system: (a) by addressing the class imbalance issue using the synthetic minority oversampling techniques ({SMOTE}) and the ensemble methods in machine learning; and (b) by evaluating the trained classifiers with both receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) and precision–recall ({PR}) curves. To that end, we trained random forest, boosted decision tree, random forest with {SMOTE}, and boosted decision tree with {SMOTE} using the big data samples of the 165,715 high school students from the National Education Information System ({NEIS}) in South Korea. According to our {ROC} and {PR} curve analysis, boosted decision tree showed the optimal performance.},

	abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

It has negative effects on the high expenditure in the administrative and academic resources. Predicting dropout has become an advantage for university administrators because it allows discovering students that are at risk of dropout as well as develop actions that allow taking decisions in a timely manner. This research presents a neural network approach through the application of multilayer perceptrom algorithms and radial basis function. As input variables to the models, 11 factors were considered, which produce a negative influence in the desertion at the universities; the data was obtained from a survey of 2670 students of a Public University in Ecuador. The results showed that there is no significant difference in the accuracy rates of the proposed models which correspond to 96.3\% for multilayer perceptrom and 96.8\% for radial basis function. As a conclusion, the studied models could be considered as an optimal option in terms of accuracy and concordance to predict dropout at the universities.},

This paper aims to contribute to the continuing debates on the possibilities how to reduce the student failure and improve educational processes with the help of data mining techniques, in particular of the artificial neural networks. The population consists of 810 students enrolled for the first time in a health care professions degree course at the University of Genoa in the academic year 2008-09. The research is based on the analysis of data and information originating from primary sources: administrative data related to the careers of students; statistical data collected during the research through an ad hoc survey; data derived from telephone interviews with students who had not completed the enrolment in the subsequent years. The neural network correctly predicted 84 percent of the cases of group 1,81 percent of the cases of group 2, and 76 percent of the cases belonging to group of dropouts.

Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

La construcción del modelo de investigación se sustentó en una exhaustiva revisión bibliográfica que permitió identificar variables explicativas de la deserción universitaria en el contexto nacional. Luego, a partir de la sistematización de antecedentes socioeducativos de los estudiantes de las cohortes 2014 y 2015 disponibles en los sistemas informáticos de la universidad, se consolidó una matriz tripartita con los datos asociados a las variables que emergieron del análisis de los referentes consultados. Consecuentemente, se analizó la relación de cada una de las variables explicativas del estudio con la variable control deserción estudiantil. El análisis bivariado permitió identificar diecisiete variables, significativamente asociadas con la deserción estudiantil y precisar las relaciones de dependencia con el abandono de estudios. El modelo multivariado predijo en un 86,4 \% la conducta de abandono señalando siete variables categóricas independientes que, finalmente, se develan como factores relevantes del modelo predicción. Las variadas y sustentadas interpretaciones entregadas en los resultados del modelo, así como las sugerencias propuestas para mejorar el índice de retención universitaria, entregan un valor directo al estudio dirigido a optimizar uno de los indicadores más importantes vinculados a una gestión de calidad en las universidades, como es, la retención estudiantil.},

Our model represents the probability that a learner provides the correct response to a question in terms of three factors: their understanding of a set of underlying concepts, the concepts involved in each question, and each question's intrinsic difficulty. We estimate these factors given the graded responses to a collection of questions. The underlying estimation problem is ill-posed in general, especially when only a subset of the questions are answered. The key observation that enables a well-posed solution is the fact that typical educational domains of interest involve only a small number of key concepts. Leveraging this observation, we develop both a bi-convex maximum-likelihood-based solution and a Bayesian solution to the resulting {SPARse} Factor Analysis ({SPARFA}) problem. We also incorporate user-defined tags on questions to facilitate the interpretability of the estimated factors. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Finally, we make a connection between {SPARFA} and noisy, binary-valued (1-bit) dictionary learning that is of independent interest.},

	abstract = {The European Union ({EU}) has repeatedly underlined the importance of higher education, research and innovation as drivers in the further development of Europe—economically, socially and culturally. One of the latest policy initiatives by the European Commission ({EC}) intended to promote this agenda is the European Universities Initiative ({EUI}) where alliances between universities across national borders are to identify new approaches for boosting European scientiﬁc cooperation. It might be argued that this development represents an attempt to ﬁnd an organizational solution to the European policy ambitions in higher education, research and innovation. This article presents a framework for analysing European university alliances. Based on interviews with persons occupying key leadership and management roles in ten alliances, the article analyses the potential gains and perils alliances might face along four dimensions: their internal coordination, their ways of resolving conﬂicts, the commitment of member universities and the cultural characteristics of the alliances.},

As a starting point we took the works of Pintrich et al (1991), and {McCann} \& Turner (2004). The variables of previous performance (grades) are the best predictors of final achievement, but if removed, metacognitive variables (Time Management and the Effort Management) and volitional strategies (Negative-Based Incentives) come into play in predicting performance. Volitional variables may be considered as latent variables with an indirect influence over the final grades, but with a direct influence over the learning strategies. Such complex relationships ({LISREL}) should be more thoroughly researched in the future. No statistical differences between men and women were found in any of the variables. The best variables to discriminate between groups of achievement (high, middle and low) were learning variables, such as time management, effort management and metacognitive self-regulation.},

From the implementation of the Organic Law of Higher Education, changes were introduced to favor this process and influence the increase of quality; nevertheless, barriers continue to exist. The purpose of this article is to analyze the causes that hinder access and cause desertion and financing alternatives, which could contribute to mitigate these. The deduction induction method was mainly used, collecting information from primary and secondary sources; for this, a sample was selected based on the student population of the universities located in Cuenca, (6854). The size was 364 and the technical questionnaire was applied to 383 students. Information was complemented with interviews and documentary reviews. As main results the causes that originate the problem are validated, these are the high costs of tuition and the loss of materials, which are identified ways to decrease the dropout. It is evident that these are few and a little diverse, which is aggravated by the ignorance of the students about the benefits offered by these institutions; in response to this, a proposal to establish policies linked to the increase of these alternatives and improve the communication process between the various institutions that offer financial services and/or scholarships to students is given.},

Posteriormente, al amparo de distintos estudios nacionales e internacionales, y nuestros resultados de investigación, elaboramos un perfil teórico que contempla: definición, causas, modelos explicativos y soluciones. Finalmente, ofrecemos una perspectiva crítica de la enseñanza universitaria, en relación al papel social que esta representa, y en relación a los actuales procesos de cambio, sobre todo el proceso de convergencia europea.},

However, research has been ambiguous about what factors can improve it. Two reasons for this ambiguity are discussed in this paper: The links between workplace learning and professional education have often not been included in research studies, and teaching may have special characteristics that make workplace learning difficult. The paper examines new empirical connections between teachers’ learning activities at work and the outcome of teacher education, using longitudinal Norwegian survey data. The results show that an active and independent study strategy increases the likelihood of consulting professionals outside work and finding information in books and journals. Furthermore, the introduction of individual characterristics substantially improves the work place impact models, and should be adopted in future research. Finally, it is discussed whether the methodological framework in existing research on teachers’ work place learning is consistent with the theoretical point of departure, or whether greater consistency should be sought.},

Both the academic and social systems of the university are regarded as important frameworks from which the dropout process must be examined.

Most universities would benefit from an early warning system that detects at-risk students before performance or social problems jeopardize their college careers. This investigation demonstrated that scores from the Survey of Academic Orientations ({SAO}) were predictive of first-semester freshmen grades. Subsequent analysis showed that the {SAO} significantly improved the prediction of grade point averages, after taking the effects of Scholastic Assessment Test scores and high school percentage rank into consideration. The {SAO} gives educators a new early warning device, a way to identify those undergraduates most at risk of receiving poor grades. The next steps in the research process are to: (1) assess the relationship of {SAO} scores to other important academic indexes, such as retention and student stress, and (2) determine if furnishing counselors and other college personnel with {SAO} scores is of therapeutic value.},

In this work, we revisit the problem of introducing student-specific parameters into {BKT} on a larger scale. We show that student-specific parameters lead to a tangible improvement when predicting the data of unseen students, and that parameterizing students’ speed of learning is more beneficial than parameterizing a priori knowledge.},

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize student entry characteristics such as college admission test scores and high school grade point averages. Logistic analysis was used to calculate and compare predicted and actual graduation rates based on student entry characteristics. Among findings were: graduation rates varied more by university than by program; time to completion varied by academic program; business and social sciences were the program areas which  experienced the largest in-migration from other areas; students entering education programs had the lowest average Scholastic Assessment Test scores whereas engineering students had the highest; students initially undecided about their major were no less likely to graduate than other students and their graduation was not delayed; there was a correlation of about .28 between actual and predicted graduation rates; and there were significant differences among institutions between actual graduation rates and predicted graduation rates.
