For our subject, we delve into the optimization of finding excellence students within the mass of registration, as well as to help students find their correct path depending on their profile. This approach should theoretically reduce students dropout within higher degree studies.
We've focused our attention on using ML to predict student dropout, as it has been under heavy study within the field. From both an analytical standpoint to a predictive one using different method, algorithm, and models of ML.

We have cut our review in two big sections. The first one will explore the importance of student choice for success, then, in the second part, we will review the field of student dropout prediction using ML. This second section itself cut into two parts, the first one focusing on the analytical approach to the problem, then, in the second part, on the predictive models used to predict student dropout in the literature.
