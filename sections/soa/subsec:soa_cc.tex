This review has shown the multifaceted nature of the issue. The analytical approach — exploring psychological, economic, and socio-cultural dimensions — has emphasized the significance of a broad spectrum of factors. The predictive approach has demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning algorithms in identifying students at risk of dropping out, with techniques like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, and Random Forest showing varying levels of precision and applicability.
From the studies in student's dropout, we can extract interesting information to base our subject on. We could use these findings and train our machines differently to predict success and not failure.
