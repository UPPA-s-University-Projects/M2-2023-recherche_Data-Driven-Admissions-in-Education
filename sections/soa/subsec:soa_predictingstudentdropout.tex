The body of literature concerning student dropout is comprehensive, encompassing a range of perspectives from diverse academic disciplines. The issue has been approached through psychological and economic lenses, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative research methods. This section is structured to reflect the various domains and methodologies present in prior studies.

We've cut this section in two major subsections. The first one, \ref{subsubsec:soa_analyticalapproach}, will review the different ways of analytical analysis on student dropout. These different approaches went from simple adaptation models to economic models and psycho-pedagogic models to predict and describe student dropout. Then, in \ref{subsec:soa_predictiveapproach} we are going to study different mathematical algorithms and models and use ML models to predict student dropout.
