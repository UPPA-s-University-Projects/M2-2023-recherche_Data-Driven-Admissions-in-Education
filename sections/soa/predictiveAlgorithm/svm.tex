\acrfull{svm} re a powerful and versatile class of supervised learning algorithms, widely recognized for their robustness and efficiency with classification and regression tasks.
This model main principle turns around the concept if finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the different classes in the feature space provided.
This is achieved by maximizing the margin between data points of different class, which are represented as vectors in the space. 
Many papers have been written about algorithm trained for optimal margin classifiers since some times now \cite{boser_training_1992}. And these algorithms have proven both robust and efficient for such tasks.  
\acrshort{svm}s are particularly good at handling high-dimensional data and are known for their ability to manage overfitting, even in complex datasets with large numbers of features.
The flexibility they provide is further exemplified through the use of kernel functions, which allow them to operate in a transformed feature space, enabling the handling of non-linear relationships between them. That's what makes \acrshort{svm} highly effective for a wide range of applications, from text classification to bio informatics.
